This project is a coding challenge from Frontend Mentor where I have to create a notifications page. I am given the starting files of html, but I have to build out the CSS and JS. I want to practice my flexbox and typescript skills, so this project is focused on implementing those technologies. Because this is a pretty straightforward project, I decided not to use any frameworks either. For more information, there's a folder containing all of the work for this project. Within that folder, you will find the frontend mentor readme explaining further details of the project.
